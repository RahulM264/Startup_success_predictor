17,Tutorspree,"E-Commerce, EdTech, Education",B2B,Web-based tuition services,"""Tutorspree was a startup in a very seasoned and competitive sector. There is no clear-cut reason for the venture failure but analyzing some of the available information might help us shed light on possible culprits. First, it probably had to do with the founders of the company and their lack of expertise in the field. Also, Tutorspree's vision of pairing up tutors and students to meet up in person so as to create and maintain a real connection is commendable but not practical. Although indeed, in-person lessons are still very much valuable, the market -and the world- is heading on to a different direction. It is also possible that the platform, which was initially taking 50% of the tutorâs fees, might have witnessed a decline in overall user growth because nothing could prevent tutors and students to schedule lessons without recurring to Tutorspree.com after they got to know each other.Another problem for Tutorspree's seemed to be that the company was primarily dependent on search traffic from Google to acquire new students and tutors, and any algorithm changes could significantly reduce their traffic and in return their users.  As resources started to dwindle and funding failed to come in, Tutorspree decided to shut down. Its assets (including its user's database) were bought by Wyzant, a tutoring marketplace launched in 2005 which is still active.""",no_data,10,"Aaron Harris, Josh Abrams, Ryan Bednar",2,M&A,New York,2010,2013,yes,75.5,1800000.0
18,Zulily,"Delivery, E-Commerce, Retail",B2C,Online retailer that offers consumers with daily product deals,"The main culprit for the downfall of the popularity of Zulily is poor marketing and user-attention strategies. Most notably, in order to access the search engine and databases of Zulily's shopping items, the platform required from new visitors to give their email address prior to even seeing what the online store had to offer. This marketing trick met with a lot of criticism since it violated some basic marketing principles. Zulily initially achieved a record success with the number of new subscribers who registered on the site, but Zulily team soon noticed that sales began rapidly to decline. People gave their mail only to peek at the site and registered users couldn't necessarily be considered loyal or even willing customers. Zulily inadequate marketing strategy and front-page email request discouraged thousands of potential new customers to sign up, while their existing users often bought only once or anyway not enough to sustain the financial stability of the company. Users also stated that they felt overwhelmed by the number of merchandise and flash sales invitation the e-shop offered so the company complied by diminishing them, and a decrease in revenue also followed. Moreover, although Zulily sometimes offered brand names for ridiculously small prices, there would often be longer than expected delivery times to customers which also earned them poor reviews.",User Retention Difficulties,8,"Darrell Cavens, Mark Vadon",5,M&A,Seattle,2009,2014,yes,3000.5,194600000.0
