Rafter,Textbook and course material provider for schools,Education,United States,2006,2016,Acquired,Competition,1,Sara Leoni,50 to 100,7,86000000.0,7,"Rafter was a textbook and course material provider for schools and colleges. The company, previously known as BookRenter, initially focused only on providing textbooks to educational institutions but decided to completely change strategy to gain an upper hand on its competitors. The company rebranded as Rafter and started providing cloud-based course material.

Rafter worked with small to medium colleges in particular, which found the bulk deals they were able to get hold of with Rafter advantageous. In this way, colleges were able to lower the prices of campus store books thus encouraging students to buy course material from the university instead of off-campus sites. Rafter also allowed instructors to find, sample and manage course material and provided digital books, audio, and video media as well as codes to access various online courses platforms.","Rafter had much competition from the start and it had to deal with both logistical, financial and market challenges from the onset. For starters, it was hard to convince large institutions to buy from the company as a single-source network of providing texts and notes. Also, not all students were pleased with Rafter’s model as they thought they could get text books for more affordable prices on their own and they didn’t appreciate the fact that the company required them to return the books at the end of the term.

However, the most crucial challenge for the company was the evolution of technology and its widespread adoption and inclusion into universities. Colleges could now directly deal online with the publisher, so the need to have a middle agent such as Rafter became minimal. Rafter announced its shut down in 2016. The digital assets of Rafter, including its Rafter360 solutions, were successively bought by eCampus in 2017."
Skully,Augmented reality motorcycle helmets,Transportation,United States,2013,2016,Shut Down,Mismanagement of Funds,1,"Marcus Weller, Mitch Weller",10 to 50,4,15000000.0,13,"Skully is a helmet trademark which targets motorcycle riders. News of the helmet generated considerable buzz as the company promised that their helmet would be the first Augmented Reality (AR) product of its industry offering unique technological features. The helmet comes with a rear facing camera and a heads-up display that can also be used to check contacts names and music streaming. The Skully helmet was to supposedly be the safest in the world since it offered a ""360° experience"" with its 180° blindspot camera. Riders could also avail of the hands-free voice calling and texting feature during their commutes.","According to Skully spokespeople they had to close shops due to limited fundings. They were reportedly not able to sum an additional round of funding to complete the production of the $2,000 pre-ordered helmets that about 3,000 people were looking forward to receiving. They filed for bankruptcy in 2016 but their product and assets were acquired in 2017 by what has been branded SKULLY Technologies, a new company that says to have no affiliation to the previous company (nor any obligations it might have to its clients) despite the fact that the two acquirers are the cousins of the previous Skully CEOs."
Wantful,Online gift-giving service,e-Commerce,United States,2011,2013,Shut Down,Competition,1,John Poisson,"10,000",1,5500000.0,8,"Wantful was an e-Commerce platform founded in 2011 with a base in San Francisco and New York City. The company targeted individuals looking to buy gifts for friends, family or acquaintances. Its objective was to help users by offering them personalized gift recommendations based on a set of input entered. The user needed to provide the site with information such as the gender, tastes and preferences of the person they were willing to donate the gift to and the platform would search through its inventory to bring a series of suggested items to the users. Wantful later expanded to allow users to find items for themselves as well and it even launched a series of popular products to complement their business.","After experiencing a brief phase of exponential growth, Wantful shut down in September 2013 due to stiff competition from other companies offering e-commerce services. While at the beginning they offered a fairly new type of platform by focusing on the customization and suggestion of gift ideas, when they tried to shift to a normal e-shop business in which users bought items for themselves they had to compete with established platforms such as Wanelo, Wish, Fancy, Svpply’s Want, Polyvore, and more.

In the later stages of the e-commerce business, it became evident that Wantful was not getting the kind of growth curves that venture capitals expected and desired and as a result failed to secure additional investment. This highly discouraged business with Nordstrom, a potential investor and strategic partner that Wantful heavily depended on for their long-term investment. The company closed in 2013."
Argyle Social,Provided social media management tools,Marketing,United States,2010,2014,Shut Down,Competition,1,Adam Covati,10 to 50,2,1600000.0,2,"The Argyle Social was a Social media marketing tool. The company provided an easy to use, highly interactive platform for marketers to specifically improve their customers’ social media platform engagement and lead generation. Argyle was considered as having one of the best price-points in the market at some point. Widely praised for their intuitive dashboard and highly effective scheduling capabilities, Argyle had been for a period one of the most sought-after programs for many internet marketers.","Adam Covati, the former CEO and founder of Argyle Social, tried to stand out from their competitors by allowing their software to be integrated into various social media marketing automation software including Pardot and Marketo. This additional design Argyle Social had was really useful for marketers, but still, the bulk and massive marketing efforts of their competitors, unfortunately, drowned out that value.

The funds were never enough to keep the software in the market, not to mention that the company still had to pay its employees.

Leading social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter change their APIs every time. For Argyle Social to work, Covati and his team needed to keep up with those changes as well, and that was a huge struggle for them. They had talent and skill but lacked the appropriate number of employees needed to accomplish such task. The company’s lack of employees came about from their first issue, which is not having enough funds. Without the appropriate funds, it was impossible for Argyle to keep their services in the market. Adam Covati said that he tried numerous times to find a willing business partner to keep the company alive, but no company or individual ever found Argyle to be “profit wise”."
QBotix,Solar panels attached and regulated by robots,Software & Hardware,United States,2010,2015,Shut Down,Competition,1,Wasiq Bokhari,10 to 50,3,23500000.0,7,"QBotix seemed like a very promising cleantech startup, so much so that it was able to raise a collective $23.5M in funding. QBotix offered solar panels that were attached and regulated by robots which could track solar light and rotate the panels automatically. The aim was that of reducing systems cost and maximize efficiency and productivity.","QBotix had a useful and innovative product. The two-axis tracker system they came up with was the first of its kind and it was supposed to be an upgrade from the one-axis solar trackers present in the market. What happened, though, was that the technology and the efficiency of their competitors in the single-axis sector improved so rapidly that it made the traditional product more cost-effective and optimized than what QBotix came up with.

Adding to that, investors realized that the market acceptance and adoption of QBotix weren't as fast as they were expecting it to be so funding started to dwindle. QBotix then tried to license the product and provide its software for other companies to use, but the move wasn't successful and they had to lay off their staff and announce the shutdown of their operations."
BitPass,Online payment system for digital content,Finances,United States,2002,2007,Shut Down,Competition,1,Kurt Huang,50 to 100,2,13300000.0,6,"Bitpass was a company that gave people a platform to make micropayments online.

Mperia, an online music store founded in 2003, was one of its greatest projects for unsigned artists. BitPass customers included giants such as Disney and Microsoft.","The main reason for closure as stated in their email was competition. The newly rolled Google Checkout payment system, which was offered for free, made BitPass business superfluous. Bitpass CEO originally hoped to get their micro payment features integrated into Google checkout but that never happened.

Leap Transit,Provider of private transit and offers bus services,Transportation,United States,2013,2015,Shut Down,Legal Challenges,1,Kyle Kirchhoff,50 to 100,1,2500000.0,4,"Leap transit was a private transport service based in San Francisco, they offered bus services with eye-catching and comfortable interiors. Leap was supposed to fill a gap in the transport system by serving people that didn't want to pay for an Uber ride every day and yet preferred a quieter environment to the public transport offered in the city. The buses had Wi-Fi, leather seats, AC sockets. They also had a mini bar offering snacks and beverages.","The primary reason for Leap quick exit from the private transport scene was their failure to comply with the San Francisco regulations. Besides not having requested permission from the city administration, they committed a second infringement when they removed the front door ramp which by law should be present in bus to make the vehicle accessible to people with disabilities.

Furthermore, although their service might have been useful, it was seen with a mix of dislike and outrage. The original inhabitant of the city generally seemed to dislike bus services that seemed to be aimed at the new “tech population” that came into the city and they even went so far as to protest their very presence. Another complaint was also that the buses also congested the SF streets.

Leap had not enough passengers to make a decent profit, even if they charged them $6 per ride. When the California Public Utilities Commission issued a cease and desist notice to the company they halted their operations.

The Springpad app was designed to empower users by organizing content.","On June 25, Springpad closed its doors. The company failed to develop a monetization strategy and despite their best efforts, things just didn’t work out in time. Although their product anticipated market needs, its market entry timing didn't work out for them. Before the company realized it, Pinterest, a competitor company was already doing the same - it was too late. Springpad started facing financial difficulties that forced it to start looking for additional funding and even contemplating acquisition by major web players. In the end, Springpad was acquired by Google. The major reason for the shutdown was having a short-sighted focus and failure to develop a good strategy that supported its product."
Monitor110,Real-time internet monitoring services,Analytics,United States,2003,2008,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,1,Roger Ehrenberg,01 to 10,3,17300000.0,4,Monitor 110 was an information and data gathering service that offered real-time internet monitoring services for Wall Street. It allowed investors to monitor internet sources for information and insight relevant to their investment and portfolio management. Their algorithm allowed customers to gather data and monitor 40 million online sources so as to get first knowledge of any new trend by essentially ‘listening in’ to online conversations and blogs that included keywords related to the financial market.,"Monitor 110 closed down its operations in July 2008 due to various reasons.

First, there wasn’t a clear leadership at the top levels. Monitor110 was directed by two people that had completely different backgrounds - which is not a bad thing - but that also had different perspectives when it came to decision making. The company also waited too much before releasing their product also due to the fact that they received substantial publicity (for example, they were featured by the Financial Times) before they had a thoroughly tested release. This got people’s expectation high and made the company reluctant to release a less than perfect product. The fact that they received $17 million might have also been counterproductive for them, as instead of building a lean beta version they kept developing the product in a vacuum based on their vision for it rather than receiving valuable feedback from customers. A technical problem they also faced was related to the amount of spam and duplicate posts that the algorithm was picking up on, it was too much and it could have diminished the value of the platform. When they finally decided on a suitable business pivot after months of indecisiveness, the company had already started running out of money and there was an unpleasant tension between the company team. The company lost also the edge they could have had in such a competitive market as theirs and decided to shut their operations in 2008."
Juicero,First home cold-pressed juicing system,Food & Beverage,United States,2013,2017,Bankruptcy,Bad Business Model,1,Doug Evans,100 to 250,4,118500000.0,16,"Juicero was a juice company that collected fresh organic fruits and vegetables for the customers, prepared, and put them in special single serve packets. It offered pre-sold packets of diced fruits and vegetables. It solved the produce gap and ensured that it took care of the washing, cutting preparing for people to eat in a simple way. It brought convenience to the people by using a Wi-Fi connected juice press that automatically squeezed the single servings packets into a glass of cold fresh juice. Juicero stated mission was helping people attain optimal health by making it easier for them to consume fresh raw foods.","Juicero failed to build a profitable business after raising a substantial amount of funds under the claim of innovation and disruption. The company received funding from high profile firms before users realized that the machines were useless.

The high initial price of $699 was already a barrier for many of its potential customers and the fact that the machine only worked with Wi-Fi was an additional inconvenience. To add to that, the company put a scannable QR code on each packet serving and the machine would not function unless it detected the presence of said code. In other words, people could not press home-made packets but had to order them from Juicero, each packet costed between $5 and $7. After months of slow sales, the company tried to sell its product at $400 and planned to offer a cheaper version in the months to come.

The company received one last blow when Bloomberg News published a video proving that simply by hand squeezing the packets you could obtain a full glass of juice and that the $700 machine was really useless. Few months after that, Juicero went bankrupt and has since been classified as another absurd Silicon Valley startup product that raised huge funds but didn’t really solve any real problem."
Salorix,Online social network engagement platform,Analytics,United States,2009,2014,Shut Down,Bad Management,1,Santanu Bhattacharya,10 to 50,2,3500000.0,2,"Salorix was an agency that offered an online networking engagement platform for brands. Through Amplify, as the AI based service was called, brands could “listen in” on ongoing social discussions which would be ranked to distinguish the most relevant key themes and influencers over different businesses for their clients. Solarix was considered to have a cutting-edge product and even received twice acquisition offers from Google in 2012 and 2013.","Salorix closed down because of inability to raise reserves after its major investors stopped supporting it. This was following a disagreement between the founder and investors over securing an offer from Google. The investors were excited about the Google offer and saw it as a good business opportunity while the Salorix founder was not awed with it.

Rumors have it that Salorix CEO asked for a higher price but Google refused and the deal didn’t go through. Soon after it was clear that the founder would not listen to their wishes and advice, investors put a stop to any additional financial support (after having initially backed up the startup with $3.5 million in Series A investment).

Digg,Enables users to share interesting stories,Social Media,United States,2004,Active,Still Active,Competition,1,Kevin Rose,50 to 100,6,49000000.0,14,Digg stated mission on launching was that of ‘democratizing’ the content and news that people saw. The concept was simple: anyone that found interesting content could ‘digg it’ and post it on the Digg site. The post and stories that received the most amount of upvotes were featured on Digg’s front page getting thus maximum exposure. The site was initially a place for geeky and tech content but it soon grew to incorporate various types of content.,"Digg is a site that missed the opportunity to become a thriving social network. The site is still active but even one of its former CEOs posts more frequently on Twitter than on his own site.

The reason Digg failed were interlinked and quite obvious to point out in hindsight.

First of all, it failed to carry on with its mission of offering a platform that was free of any group’s agenda. As a matter of fact, anyone with a large circle of friends or with a numerous follower’s base (or the highest number of fake accounts) could message their posts to get the most amount of upvotes within hours, not because of the quality of the content of the post, but simply because of the connections that that specific ‘power user’ had. In an attempt to remedy to this, the site disabled the messaging feature it had and only allowed sharing with their friends by means of Facebook and Twitter. As you can imagine, the move didn’t do them any good, not only that, but it left their users dissatisfied (to say the least) by the newly implemented restriction.

And yet, these were not the only changes Digg’s team made that distanced its users. In 2010, Digg came back with a new design that, alas, had even fewer features. Digg v4, as it was called, did away with features such as down voting posts, saving favorites and posting videos.

Digg had the advantage of being the early mover since it was founded in 2004 and valued at $160 million in 2008, but it failed to adapt to its growing user base and renew the mission it had. Another bookmarking site, Reddit, slowly but inevitably started to catch up with it. As Digg users left the platform in 2010, there was Reddit offering them a ready and welcoming alternative. The interesting and inviting thing about Reddit, which is basically a spinoff of Digg, was that user content was encouraged and this allowed the platform to thrive. Self-promotion and publishing of one’s own content on Digg, instead, seemed to be frowned upon. Reddit valued and nurtured its community in ways Digg wasn’t able to do.

There were rumors that Digg would be brought back and improved upon as an app, but even so, by now it would face quite a bit of competition."
Turntable.fm,Online interactive platform for DJs and listeners,Music,United States,2011,2013,Shut Down,Bad Business Model,1,Billy Chasen,01 to 10,1,7000000.0,10,"Turntable.fm was an online interactive platform on which DJ, fans and casual listeners were brought together.

MatterFab,Selling affordable solutions for metal 3-D printing,Software & Hardware,United States,2013,2019,Shut Down,Bad Business Model,1,Matthew Burris,01 to 10,3,13200000.0,7,"The world of additive manufacturing has widely been promoted as the embodiment of the future. 3D printers are the machines that are making this into a reality. Using metal as the raw material for printing has made 3D printing more than just a hobby. Airline juggernauts like Airbus and General Electric have been replacing traditionally made engine parts with lighter, 3D printed ones. This saves them millions in fuel costs. The major downside to all this has been the $1 million price tag. MatterFab, founded in 2013, came to the rescue with the goal of making metal-based additive manufacturing affordable.","The Seattle based startup had a promising pitch and a noble cause - Making metal-based additive manufacturing an affordable reality. The company had stated that this is because of the experience of the team, which allows them to pull a dozen different engineering disciplines together and come up with workable solutions. MatterFab had initially shown serious promise, as their 3D printers were supposed to be about 10% of the price of a regular metal 3D printer.

MatterFab received $7.48M funding in February 2015. This was followed by $5.75M in May of that year, making the startup one of the most funded new enterprises in the 3D printing industry. Investors included GE and AutoDesk.

One cause for the failure of this once-promising startup can be stated in the words of Josh Ewing from AutoDesk - “We believed in MatterFab’s approach and vision, but unfortunately it didn’t succeed in the marketplace.”

Dave Warren, who is the co-founder and former CTO had left MatterFab in March 2016 to pursue a career with a Stealth Drone Startup. The other co-founder, Matt Burris had already left in October 2015. The reasoning from the investors' perspectives was that they needed a more experienced management team to lead the business. That team that followed them included Matt Paterson (the CTO brought in to replace Warren), but Patterson himself left MatterFab in March 2017.

A deeper problem besides this was the sad financial state of the company. With over $13 million raised since February 2015, the company appears to have burned through over half a million a month in 2016 alone!

Also, with GE purchasing established metal AM enterprises (like Concept Laser and Arcam) and their plans to launch the world’s largest metal 3D printer (ATLAS), their initial enthusiasm in investing in MatterFab may have evaporated before things could take-off successfully."
Aria Insights,Air vehicles for search and rescue missions,Software & Hardware,United States,2008,2019,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,1,Helen Greiner,10 to 50,7,39000000.0,8,"Aria, formerly known as CyPhy Works was a US-based drone manufacturer that specialized in developing highly advanced drones. Their flagship product was called PARC - Persistent Aerial Reconnaissance and Communication, and was a tethered drone that had a particularly long flight time - instead of hours one could measure it in days. The drone was also known for its ability to sustain harsh weather conditions, making it perfect for “rough use”. As such, many of Aria’s clients were related to law enforcement and the military. Aria also targeted clients related to first response, telecommunications and the oil and gas industry.","There are various reasons why Aria ultimately failed. What they all have in common is that they’re complex in and of themselves. For example, Aria’s founder, Helen Greiner left the company back in 2018. When a company loses its founder, momentum shifts. The core philosophy of the company is being “sucked out” and replaced by someone else. 

Naturally, that’s likely not the only reason. Another reason could have been Aria’s decision to move away from producing drones and drone technology to focusing on developing smart AI systems and drone programs. Aria re-launched in January 2019 and said that a number of their partners were focused on collecting and storing massive amounts of information using Aria’s drones. However, nobody could offer Aria’s partners the possibility to quickly turn the data into actionable insights.

Aria discovered a new possibility in the market that nobody else was offering at that time. And for sure, looking for new ways to serve their clients is always a healthy sign, but this time, Aria took things a little too far.

Since there was no other company offering that particular service, it might have been a sign that demand really wasn’t that big after all. And Aria might have gotten the wrong impression that since their actual partners craved the technology to store and interpret massive amounts of information, that was also the case with the rest of the drone market.

Ultimately that proved not to be the case and quite likely, commercial demand and regulations were just too slow to catch up with the supply of drone solutions.

It’s an example where a company offers a solution to a problem that really doesn’t exist yet on such a large scale that it’s possible to monetize from it. In other words, the company was way ahead of itself."
Vreal,VR game-streaming platform,Entertainment,United States,2015,Active,Shut Down,Bad Timing,1,Todd Hooper,10 to 50,3,15000000.0,13,"Started in 2015, Vreal was a virtual reality startup that enabled users to create avatars and interact with content creators and players on a shared VR space. The startup managed to snag more than $15 million from VC firms including Axioma Ventures, Upfront Ventures, and Intel Capital. Vreal allowed players to watch immersive content while being inside the game, think of it as ‘Twitch for VR’ (Twitch is a live-streaming platform for gamers). They had more than two dozen employees before they decided to shut shop in August 2019.","The startup themselves admitted that they were ahead of their time with a product whose market was never fully developed. They expected the VR market to grow at a much faster rate, but it didn’t happen at the speed they expected.  

The virtual reality headset market had four consecutive quarters of decline before it returned to show signs of growth in Q3 2018. Enterprises have opened themselves up to adopting VR for its uses in different industries like healthcare, education, manufacturing, and firms that want to provide a different customer experience. But consumers haven’t cozied up to it because of its steep price and inability to understand how to use it. In other words, VR hasn’t gone mainstream yet.

Vreal’s failure looks more like collateral damage to the downward slide that the VR industry faced. It just wasn’t time. Its founder, Todd Hooper, has founded and operated a lot of companies in the entertainment space, including gaming. It looks like he had the right set of skills to win at a startup in this space. Vreal is the story of a company that was in the right place at the wrong time. 

Vreal’s competitor Virtalis develops visualization systems for defense, construction and military sectors. This is an indicator of how a product pivot could have saved Vreal. Since there were very few VR headset manufacturers at that time, like HTC, Oculus, Samsung, Xiaomi, and Sony, the price of these products wasn’t affordable for the majority as well. The fact that VR headsets weren’t cheap (they still aren’t) just added to Vreal’s problem as they insisted on having the VR hardware to be able to enjoy the content thus limiting their reach. 

Also, remember that Vreal operated in a sub-niche with a product that wasn’t widely adopted yet. There were just too many things that didn’t fall into place for Vreal to succeed. The adoption of VR technology will not die down as it holds significant potential for the long-term. We will soon see more startups in the VR headset space, especially for the gaming fans. "
Theranos,Consumer healthcare technology company,Health,United States,2003,2018,Shut Down,Legal Challenges,1,Elizabeth Holmes,10 to 50,10,1400000000.0,16,"Founded in 2003 by then 19-year-old Elizabeth Holmes, biotech upstart Theranos claimed to have devised a way to predict the onset of life-threatening diseases using just small amounts of blood samples—their revolutionary technology requiring only about 1/100 to 1/1,000 of the amount of blood that would ordinarily be needed for pre-existing tests. It then recommended preventative medical cures based on those results. Theranos was hailed as a revolutionary startup that raised more than $700 million in venture capital and private investor funding. At its peak around 2014, the company was valued at a whopping $10 billion.","Elizabeth Holmes was a real sensation in the media, often featured on the covers of various business magazines and lists of top executives and innovators. On top of this, she was also honored with an interview with former US President Bill Clinton. During these media opportunities, Holmes stated that Theranos’ goal was to give people the power to have critical health information at the time it mattered and that she wanted to create a world in which no one ever had to say the phrase ""if only I had known sooner."" 

However, despite this ambitious goal, in October of 2015, when investigative reporter John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal questioned the validity of Theranos' technology, Holmes and her company started slipping into hotter and hotter water. The company soon found itself facing legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities and investors. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state attorney generals, former business partners, and former patients among other parties got involved in uncovering the fraud and by June of 2016, it was estimated that Holmes's personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing following Holmes’ charging of wire fraud, among a list of other accusations. Soon after this, in September 2018, Theranos ceased operations. 

So what exactly happened here? Why did it take over a decade to expose this company? 

The story begins much earlier in 2002 when Elizabeth Holmes arrived at Stanford University with her breakthrough ideas. Holmes wanted to build a patch that would scan the wearer for infections and through its results, release the necessary antibiotics a patient needed. However, Dr. Phyllis Gardner, Holmes’ professor, tried to explain to her that the antibiotics Holmes wanted to use needed to be given at higher doses than a patch could deliver and that her idea would be difficult to implement. Undeterred, Holmes went on to drop out of Stanford University in 2003 at the age of 19 to start Theranos, then called Real-Time Cures under the disproven premise. As John Carreyrou points out in his thrilling non-fiction masterpiece, Bad Blood, Holmes had an unusual obsession with Steve Jobs that manifested in an obsessive copying of Job’s dressing style and making her employees read his books. Holmes had also infamously claimed that her device would soon be the “iPod of healthcare.” This “Apple complex” that Holmes possessed also led her to spy on her employees and demanded absolute loyalty from them.  

As Holmes’ scaled Theranos up and members of the team inevitably found out about the fabled, fraudulent technology, as the company scaled up operations, various early ""disgruntled employees"" were fired, threatened, and sued for trying to expose the reliability of the technology that Holmes claimed as revolutionary. The fraud was exposed when a former employee during the peak years of the company, Tyler Shultz, had attempted to bring concerns about the company's activities to his management, and when that had failed, he had spoken to Carreyrou and under an alias, reported the company to the New York State Department of Health. Despite ardent efforts by Holmes trying to get Rupert Murdoch to shut down the story that Carreyrou published on her, everything came crumbling downhill for what’s gone down as possibly one of the biggest frauds ever in the healthcare industry.

The two main unique selling points of the service were that the content could be watched both in landscape and in portrait mode and that the episodes were short enough (from 5 to 15 minutes) to be watched while on the move - e.g. when commuting by train, waiting in a line, etc. The premise of the streaming service was that the existing solutions were not convenient to watch on mobile phones while on the go, which left a hole in the market.

The name Quibi derived from Quick Bites, the name that the service gave to these short ~10-minute episodes.

‍","1) Coronavirus
""I attribute everything that has gone wrong to coronavirus"" (source).

This line by Katzenberg is commonly quoted when Quibi’s failure is discussed, even though later on he walked back on his statement and said “Simply to blame it on COVID is not fair, and not something either of us (Whitman and him) want to do” (source).

The pandemic was the obvious, easy excuse that allowed the executive team to save face. People’s routine changed, and the train and subway commutes and queues in shops that Quibi was counting on became much rarer.

Yet, TikTok usage was growing during the pandemic, and presumably, TikTok relies on mobile usage just as much as Quibi. This is a clear indicator that people didn’t entirely stop using their phones in favor of their TVs and PCs because of COVID, and even though the Coronavirus might have made Quibi’s life more complicated, it’s obviously not the sole reason for the app’s failure.

‍

2) Content
If you are searching for a single major reason for the app’s failure, it is content.

After all, it’s a video-on-demand service, and if people find value in it depends entirely on the content it provides - its quality and scope.

Simply calling the shows bad is too subjective, but the consensus seems to strongly point in that direction.

Quibi was mass-buying all content that it could get its hands on because it needed to build a large enough library to compete with other streaming services. Naturally, needing a lot of content fast means you can’t have extremely high standards: “If we have a show that’s going to be a huge hit, you pitch to Netflix, HBO. If it doesn’t get traction, you pitch to Quibi” (source).

Going after projects that Netflix and HBO rejected, however, has another implication - these projects were not created with Quibi’s short-form format in mind. The service bought feature-length movies, and chopped them into pieces to make a “series”. Naturally, this approach doesn’t give great results, and could easily turn an OK movie into a frustrating watching experience.

That said, the fact that there was a lot of bad content on the platform wouldn’t be that much of a problem if there was one amazing show that was a must-watch. Streaming services need a killer show just as much as platforms need a killer app.

Quibi’s competition is well aware of this - when Game of Thrones was on its last episodes, HBO made a huge effort to advertise its other content because it realized very well that a lot of people were subscribed just to watch Game of Thrones. Thankfully for HBO, they had another big hit, Chernobyl, very shortly after the conclusion of Game of Thrones.

Quibi never had a killer show. What this means is that it never had a real reason for people to subscribe.

‍

3) Marketing
It seems that Quibi entirely missed the point that people subscribed to their streaming services because of the content, rather than the service itself. All of Quibi’s marketing efforts were focused on the platform and its uniqueness, rather than on its best shows.

Moreover, Quibi’s promotional efforts were more reminiscent of the ad campaigns of traditional brick and mortar businesses rather than the social-heavy, virality-based, low CAC campaigns of B2C tech startups.

A great example is the expensive Superbowl ad that Quibi launched before it was even available. 


Another is its Oscars ad. Both seemed to be driven by ego rather than by a good understanding of Quibi’s audience. The service was targeting millennials, yet the average Oscars viewer is in their 50s.

In unconfirmed market research after the two ads, 70 percent of respondents said they thought Quibi was a food-delivery service (source).

‍

4) Features
Quibi’s failure to understand and connect to its target audience was just as apparent in its (lack of) features as it was in its marketing.

Quibi was a mobile app for content, yet for a long time, it didn’t allow users to easily take clips and screenshots that could be shared on social media. Quibi failed to understand that a large segment of their users wanted to turn what they were watching into content for their own social media and that these were their most important users who would actively bring more people to their service.

So, Quibi not only failed to actively advertise their content, but the service prevented the content from spreading naturally through virality.

The exclusive focus on mobile was a deliberate decision - Quibi didn’t want to compete directly with Netflix, it wanted to focus on its USP, which was short drama content for your phone. Yet, the decision backfired because the pandemic meant more people were stuck at home. Quibi introduced the ability to broadcast content to your TV, but this feature came too late to make a major difference.

Moreover, the focus on mobile meant that Quibi was actually competing directly for screen time with two other video-on-demand giants: TikTok and YouTube, which have the big benefit that they are free (later on, Quibi experimented with a free pricing tier in New Zealand, but the results weren’t good enough to give hope for the service).

Last but not least, the service’s major innovative feature, the ability to watch a show on your phone both horizontally and vertically, was also very problematic. It’s easy to argue that it is a gimmick and it’s questionable if it adds any real value. This is a problem because the feature requires anyone developing content for Quibi to develop it with both portrait and landscape in mind, adding a layer of complexity. Moreover, as we already mentioned, a lot of the content on the platform wasn’t created specifically for Quibi. This means that it wasn’t created with this feature in mind, and for a large chunk of the content portrait mode simply didn’t work as well as landscape.

‍

5) Leadership Problems
In fact, it is quite apparent Quibi’s leadership was far removed from their audience and the tech world as a whole. When asked about her favorite show, Whitman said that she wasn’t sure she would call herself an entertainment enthusiast, but she liked Grant on The History Channel (source). It’s quite obvious she didn’t consume what she was selling - first, she didn’t give a Quibi show as an example, and second, she admitted not to consume too much entertainment content as a whole.

Being in their sixties, it’s obvious that the two company leaders were far removed from their target audience. The problem is that they didn’t seem to think so themselves. The same Vulture feature quotes a person with first-hand experience at the company: “Unless you agree with them, you’re a troublemaker. Meg believes she’s a marketing genius; Jeffrey believes he’s a content genius. So you end up in shitty jobs where you’re there to execute their vision, which no one else there believes in.”

As if this wasn’t a strong enough red flag, it seems the two leaders were in a clash themselves, as Whitman complained that Katzenberg was undermining her authority (source).

‍

6) Lack of Problem Validation
The fact that the service came out of Hollywood rather than Silicon Valley was probably beneficial in terms of content but detrimental in terms of properly running an innovative startup.

Why do people need Quibi? Maybe if people have a few minutes to kill on their phone, they’d prefer watching video content on TikTok and YouTube rather than drama series.

Quibi never ran an MVP (minimum viable product) or any experimental public beta to try to test what kind of content and what kind of features resonated well with their target users.

The assumption that people would like to watch short drama series episodes when they had a few minutes to kill on their phone wasn’t validated. Because of this, Katzenberg and co. were essentially running a $2B dollar high-risk experiment. These kinds of experiments could have been run for much, much cheaper under the lean startup principles - an industry-standard in the startup world.

The biggest startup mistake is to build something nobody needs, and 34% of startups fail due to lack of product-market fit. It’s hard to argue that Quibi doesn’t fall into this category. It’s easy to imagine that chopping up a movie into 20 pieces doesn’t add any real value.

‍

7) Overfunding
Overfunding was not the reason for Quibi’s failure, but it was the reason for the service to shut down.

A lot of startups would kill to have 500k people paying $5 or $8 per month for their service, but 500k subscribers with no indicators of growth are simply not enough to pay for a $2B investment.

By raising close to $2B before even launching, Quibi put itself in a position in which it would either become one of the major players on the streaming market, or it would be forced to shut down.

It’s plausible that there is a market niche for a mobile-first streaming service but it’s unlikely to be big enough to bring a company to the size of Netflix or HBO. By fundraising in a more conventional manner (pre-seed and seed for validation experiments, series A, B, C, etc. for scaling), Quibi might have become a profitable, albeit smaller streaming service. Equally importantly, it could have done it without burning close to $2B (most of which on content) along the way. "

Registered users could lease a luxury car for a determined amount of time after going through background checks and paying security deposits.,"HiGear had started operations at a high note and instituted many controls to ensure smooth operations. Despite such elaborate controls, the company was forced to shut down for various reasons. The main reason that HiGear lists as having prompted them to stop the business was when a criminal gang stole four cars that had a combined worth of $400,000. The criminals succeeded in the scheme by using stolen identities to evade the company's background check controls. In an email to its customers, HiGear stated that it had the duty to protect its customers and that it opted to shut down operations until they were able to put in place proper countermeasures.

Secret,Online platform to share personal secrets,Social Media,United States,2013,2015,Shut Down,Legal Challenges,2,"Chrys Bader-Wechseler, David Byttow",10 to 50,3,35000000.0,21,Secret was an Android and iOS app that allowed users to post content anonymously with their circle of friends or share it with a wider public. The app gained interest - and was at one point valued at 100 million- because it provided an outlet to those that didn’t want to be bound by the ‘real name’ rule of other social applications and face consequences for sharing their opinions and preferences. It also distinguished itself from other anonymous apps in that its interest factor for users could be higher since they knew that the person that shared a certain post on the app was someone that was in their contact list or circle of friends. The app became very addictive and some users said they routinely went through the motion of uninstalling the app only to install it again soon after that. The app was especially used in Silicon Valley.,"The number of active users of the app rapidly declined after only 18 months from its launch.

After the initial thrill and interest of the users, a more negative and unpleasant use of the app emerged. Users, under the cloak of anonymity, engaged in all forms of cyberbullying and harassment. Secret moderators stated they weren’t ready to deal with the flood of negative posts and inappropriate behavior.

As cyberbullying stories increased, so did the media news that covered such stories. A court ruling in Brazil even banned Secret from the country deeming it unconstitutional since although free speech was allowed, free speech (and the harassments that said speech could contain) should not be anonymous.

The app lost traction and was eventually suspended."

The site offered heavily discounted invite only flash sales to its customers and gained huge popularity and rave reviews in its first operational months. Most products were initially from little-known brands and included prenatal care products, baby gear, travel accessories, bedding and bath, children's clothing, toys, DVDs, and educational materials. The site also promised to be an eco-friendly site that would plant a tree for each new purchase on the site in the name of the buyer’s child.","The main culprit for the downfall of the popularity of Zulily is poor marketing and user-attention strategies. Most notably, in order to access the search engine and databases of Zulily’s shopping items, the platform required new visitors to give their email addresses prior to even seeing what the online store had to offer. This marketing trick met with a lot of criticism because it violated some basic marketing principles. Zulily initially achieved record success with the number of new subscribers who registered on the site, but the Zulily team soon noticed that sales began rapidly to decline. People gave their mail only to peek at the site and registered users couldn’t necessarily be considered loyal or even willing customers. Zulily's inadequate marketing strategy and front-page email requests discouraged thousands of potential new customers to sign up, while their existing users often bought only once or anyway not enough to sustain the financial stability of the company. Users also stated that they felt overwhelmed by the number of merchandise and flash sales invitations the e-shop offered so the company complied by diminishing them, and a decrease in revenue also followed.

Moreover, although Zulily sometimes offered brand names for ridiculously small prices, there would often be longer than expected delivery times to customers which also earned them poor reviews."
EventVue,Built online communities for conferences,Finances,United States,2007,2010,Shut Down,Lack of PMF,2,"Josh Fraser, Rob Johnson",01 to 10,2,455000.0,9,EventVue was as a social private network whose aim was to assist online communities to have a better conference networking experience. This platform helped attendees connect from different parts even before they met at the conference. The platform sought to make social connections easier for people who frequently traveled to attend conferences around the world but end up not knowing or not interacting with their fellow attendees before and after they got to the event. The startup later pivoted to become an event discovery platform.,"EventVue shutdown in February 2010, due to the fact that it lacked product-market fit and failed to test early on their assumptions about the usefulness of the product from their target customers view.

EventVue co-founder Josh Fraser wrote in a postmortem that EventVue was a Vitamin instead of a painkiller, the platform was ‘nice to have’ but not necessarily needed by conference organizers. Despite the fact that organizers thought it was a good platform for connectivity and interaction, they weren’t particularly interested in paying for it since it didn’t bring them any additional revenue, cut any of their expenses or make their business any better. Being able to sell more tickets was the primary focus of conference organizers and their product wasn’t addressing that need.

Discovering this, EventVue decided to take a different approach by introducing the EventVue Discover widget which automatically notified people about who else would be attending the conference in hope that this would increase ticket sales for the event. However, this feature backfired at them and sales actually dropped. It seemed that most attendees used the widget to check if friends and acquaintances would attend and when they learned that no one they knew didn’t sign up they refrained from purchasing conference tickets."
Totsy,E-commerce selling prenatal care products,e-Commerce,United States,2009,2013,Shut Down,Poor Product,2,"Christophe Garnier, Guillaume Gauthereau",50 to 100,4,29500000.0,4,"Totsy, like other online shopping platforms, became widely known and used by millions of users during the era of the economic recession which brought a sudden, severe and prolonged fall in the price, value, and amount of goods. This flash sale company’s policies were extremely popular with the customers at the time, because they offered high-end fashion brands online for a low-price. They stored and sold the same fashion accessories and apparel which official stores were unable to sell for the regular price.
","Ever-changing circumstances were involved for the most part in the collapse of this online retailer of high-quality and branded apparel that had a luminous moment in unstable financial times.

In order to cope with the recession and maintain their position above the margin, manufacturers started to sell their stored products at heavily discounted prices. This provided online flash sell companies with the perfect momentum to rise and thrive. Once the economy started improving, though, and customers regained their purchasing power, flash sales marketplaces started seeing a steady decrease in sales. At the same time, luxury brands rapidly recovered from the previous economic crisis and continued once again to produce their high-end product. Manufacturers decided to not let their high-end brands sell for bargain prices anymore and abandoned the idea of participating in flash sales in order to maintain their reputation and stable income. This meant that flash sales lost their core attractiveness and became generally obsolete. The momentum ended and so did the future of the company.

Gowalla,Social Guide to world's cities,Social Media,United States,2007,2013,Acquired,Competition,2,"Josh Williams, Scott Raymond",10 to 50,3,10400000.0,11,"Gowalla was a location-based social platform website and app that allowed users to check-in and share with others their location. It was launched in 2007 and had as a major competitor Foursquare, also a location-based app. The latter, however, has had way more success and currently boasts a user base of 45 million people while Gowalla shut down in 2012 as it reached 600,000 users.

Gowalla’s main feature was the check-in option for its users when they were close to certain “Spots”. The platform also gamified and encouraged users to actively share their location. Users could achieve a higher role and gain access to certain features if they demonstrated a high level of engagement with the app and sometimes received “items” that were provided by partner companies as promotional tools.","When the Gowalla team realized that their competitors in the check-in service were far ahead of them, it reinvents itself and tried to come up with a different design which was to support the newfound focus as a traveling and storytelling platform.

The main problem with Gowalla seemed to be that it tried to do and be too many things at once, whereas Foursquare, for one, focused on one or two basic services that users would infallibly go back to.

Gowalla had a better design and was aesthetically more pleasing, and yet FSQ, which launched in the densely populated New York, saw a rapid growth because users recommend it to their friends for the check-in and rewards features it offered and received social validation for using it, since ‘everyone’ was using it.

Funding was also probably not the main problem for the startup as Gowalla raised 3M in investments and partnered with giants such as Disney, National Geographic, and several major U.S. Universities.

Gowalla’s team joined Facebook in December 2011. Facebook claimed that it acquired the app but that it wouldn’t make use of the user data that it had generated over the years. FB representatives stated that they were rather more interested in partnering with the developers that brought forward the startup since they shared similar values and vision and could help enhance certain aspects of FB’s platform.

PostRocket had the goal of creating awareness by posting more engaging and friendly posts through the use of an algorithm that sorted out what the most effective posts for targeted users were. PostRocket helped FB page owners get custom content recommendations tailored to their specific customer base. Page owners could get Insights from their own panel which would help them optimize their post for type, frequency, content, and timing.","After three years of operations, Post Rocket closed down in August 2013. The CEO of the company, Timothy Chae, reported to its customers through an email some of the main reasons for the closure.

First, Chae admitted that the company had set for itself unrealistic goals, which were hard to strategize and they achieve most of them. Their product was unreliable and they were not able to quickly expand also due to how the landscape of Facebook marketing changed. Many technical issues like bugs and periods of downtime affected the quality of their service and they were not able to get rid of them since they also had to keep up with the frequent changes on the FB platform.

Most importantly, FB itself rolled out in that period its own Insights service which any Page owner could use for free to learn about their audience, receive detailed statistics and receive optimization suggestions. Chae actually encouraged his customers to use FB Insights in his shutdown announcement email.

The actual Wesabe web application also integrated community forums which include a dozen other people who are devoted to making smarter and better financial decisions.,"The tragic downfall of Wesabe can be ascribed to two major reasons.

To understand the first one, we need to talk about Yodlee. Yodlee is a company that offers an automatic data aggregation system for PFMs. This was usually done by screen-scraping the client’s bank account website activity on the supported bank corporations by Wesabe. This information is then transferred to the PFM's own platform for them to analyze. On a meeting with Wesabe, both parties never agreed to close the deal since Wesabe referred to Yodlee as a “crumbling corporation” and was afraid they wouldn’t be able to follow through. Because of these instances, Wesabe opted for a different solution. Instead of working with Yodlee, Wesabe chose to make their own data acquisition program which was to supposedly have better privacy settings for clients. This move, however, later resulted in Wesabe losing to Mint - their main competitor- since Wesabe’s data acquisition system was never fully finished. Instead, when Mint launched into the market a few months after Wesabe, it had its own data aggregation system, all thanks to its partnership with Yodlee.

Apart from that, there was also the fact that Mint provided a better and easier user experience. Mint’s system automatically categorized and edited the client’s data which resulted in a better consumer experience. While Wesabe’s clients needed to fill out more fields on sign-up forms, which was a little bit of a hassle for most people who often opted for the easier choice even though Wesabe’s platform was more precise and would have helped them make better financial decisions on the long run.

The platform saw a rapid growth on its launch: 1 million users in less than two months. It allowed people to anonymously ask questions and send messages to other users without having to sign up.,"As with any other platform that gains its attraction for its anonymous features, Formspring’s users rushed in, but as the user base increased so did the problems that were associated with anonymity. Cyberbullying came to the level that several teen suicides were linked to the bullying that took place on the site.

The startup tried to remedy by collaborating with the MIT Lab to search for a way to discourage cyberbullying. Eventually, the site had to limit the anonymity feature but that meant that it would lose its appeal, users started decreasing and growth simply froze.

If success leaves clues, so does failure. Many platforms that focused solely on anonymous interactions had to pull out the plug because of the predictable type of behavior that people tend to have when they can’t or don’t have to be accountable for their actions,even when those actions directly endangered the psychological or physical well-being of another human being."

Unlike others companies, maple gave full restaurant experience for it had its own apps, delivery staff, and kitchens. The idea was to have top chefs prepare the main menu and have satellite kitchens provide the complementary dishes. Since the business didn’t have to incur in the high expenses that come when opening an actual restaurant, they could afford to provide premium dishes at an affordable price.","Maple’s original plan when they started out in 2015 was to offer customers great food at reasonable prices. However, leaked reports from the company revealed that Maple was losing money on each delivered meal and it only began making a 30 cents profit on meals from 2016. Although they first relied on their investor’s fundings to cover operational costs, the forecasted losses were too high and they wouldn't be able to sustain it. So, they increased the price, added delivery fees, and changed ways of computing sales tax. These sudden price increases led many customers to shift to other providers that offered the same or better services for less money.

Maple also spent a lot to buy expensive grass-fed beef, antibiotic-free chicken, and also imported pricey oils. Some sources claim that Maple lacked the operational chops to prepare and deliver meals on scale while maintaining quality and producing a profit. Maple kitchens were also not well equipped to cook 10,000 meals a day.

Furthermore, when Maple launched they used to give a complimentary maple sugar cookie, afterward they withdrew them saying that they were moving away from all kinds of non-natural products to good simple food. This might have ulteriorly displeased customers that became accustomed to the signature free of charge cookie after each order.

Choosing the ‘wrong market’ was mentioned as one of their major mistakes. Since the beginning they were taken by their clients as being an open-source tool and pretty much no one wanted to pay for it. If a substantial price barrier would have been put, users would have probably searched for another tool in the ocean of free and open-source tools that other developers make available. Another major blunder was that despite they focused on seemingly important metrics, these weren’t the metrics users and clients were primarily interested in. Their ‘metrics of goodness’ according to the startup were releasing a flawless product (and yet their successful competitors at MongoDB became very popular even though they had an initial buggy product), design a simple interface, and database consistency. On the other hand, customers wanted the products to be available as soon as possible (they had to wait almost 3 years for RethinkDB), speedy performance, and a good and tried way to store JSON documents and create reports.

Teforia initially costed over $1000, the company also sold prepackaged leaf packets.","The first reason why Teforia was deemed to fail despite the substantial capital it raised was the absence of market fit for the product. Even if tea enthusiast were so particular about their tea they would have thought twice about spending a $1K on a tea making machine. The problem was also the fact that according to some reviews the tea didn’t taste better than that made in the traditional manner. The accompanying sets of cups were also delicate and high maintenance, which defeated the stated purpose the app of making the tea ritual more convenient and enjoyable. The company claimed that people were not ready nor ‘learned’ enough to appreciate the fine details that made the product so needed.

OpTier technology provided a way to empower trade arrangements by analyzing billions of business transactions daily and offered insights that aimed at helping companies proactively manage their businesses.,"One of the main reasons that were recognized as having pushed the founders of OpTier to discontinue the application was the little market share, revenue and investment capital to re-position and regain growth.

OpTier was founded when websites were the main center of attention were website-based application and their technology required months in order to provide meaningful transaction monitoring. However new companies were able to provide the same service in a matter of hours and OpTier wasn’t quick enough to adapt to the new market expectations.

Another element that factored in OpTier becoming suddenly obsolete was the launch of the iPhone and the start of the mobile based applications. Mobile phone brought up a system of interaction compared to the later where the focus was on monitoring system performance and APM had to expand to analyze customer trends across multiple channels. OpTier, which had already started having losses, lacked enough capital to implement such profound changes to its technology so as to meet the new customers’ demands."

Online reviews of the company show that the service that claimed to be the safest and most reliable to children, would routinely leave kids stranded, cancel the booking at the last moment or make them wait for long times. Shuddle customer support was also poor and, apparently, often no one would answer or return calls. Although there were parents who routinely used the app and coped with the shortcomings since there was no other similar service in the area, there was still a big chunk of parents that would try the service once and vow to never use it again for how inconvenient it was.

Adding to the service quality, there were also concerns about security since Shuddle did not subject their drivers to fingerprints background checks claiming at one point that they were too expensive for them or that they were not needed.

Their business strategy also seemed faulty. Reports state that the company lost a lot of money on several rides and that they incurred losses on every ride they made before 2016. They charged a $9 per month subscription fee plus the ever-changing fare fees, and yet was said to struggle to pay for its operational costs and employees’ salaries.

Design Inc. allowed designers to autonomously send proposals for the projects they would like to work on while charging a small fee for it. The platform helped designers all over the world to find their dream projects and companies were happy to be able to choose from a talented pool of designers.,"Design Inc. reached market saturation after some time. The number of projects and companies were not increasing and the startup could not make enough revenue to cover operation costs. This put the company in a low cash situation and they founder took the decision to close it down.

Design Inc. CEO identified a number of reasons that he believed contributed to the failure of his company. He stated that he should have been more focused on the essentials of business, which is getting more leads and profit. He also mentioned that a startup founder should also test his assumptions and keep on optimizing the product in every little way. Team members should also be encouraged to experiment without fear.

Another broader issue that is not exclusively linked to Design Inc. may be with the business model itself since the design field is considered a top-end market where job posts are scarce by nature. Too many designers compete for only a limited number of design jobs, thus causing the market to saturate too soon. Another reason why the company might have not witnessed a growth in its network could have been due to the fact that although designers are introduced to the clients by Design Inc. platform, in the end, they might decide to continue their business transactions independently from the marketplace."

Kiko granted users the ability to invite and share calendars and events with anyone.","Kiko lasted for just three years. The founders have moved to work on other projects, but they explained the reasons for their startup’s failure in a post.

The first reason according to one of the founders was that their team had wanted to work on various ideas and plans at the same time, this diverted their attention from their main project and ended up creating delays. The CEO admitted that they were too slow at times and wasted time on unnecessary things and neglected other matter that was instead crucial. To make it worse, they hired a wrong team member which affected the company’s productivity as he didn’t complete any task and disappeared for months. Failure to involve investors and seek their guidance from the beginning was also another blunder.

The software that powered Kiko was put for sale on eBay and it was bought for $258,100 in an auction.

One of the greatest challenges they faced was intense competition from other companies offering similar services. The on-demand market was particularly crowded in the food delivering space, hence they had to compete in an already saturated market where the differentiating factor was poor.

On-demand startups rely on the contact with the consumers and the perception they have of the company, SpoonRocket failed terribly at creating trust and loyalty into their customer base. Their drivers were late on deliveries, which led to dissatisfaction to customers which ended up giving them bad reviews.

One of the features Sidecar introduced was that of enabling riders to set their own price. In general, the app of the company offered much more control over their riding experience both for drivers and riders.","Sidecar had top-notch technology but no marketing strategy. Car-hailing services depend on the traction present in the market and the network of drivers and passengers that they build. Sidecar could only become useful - and profitable - if there was always a high density of drivers and users. This is mainly where Sidecar failed. Unlike their giant competitors (Uber and Lyft) they didn't invest enough to market their product and gain customers. Uber reportedly lost almost a million in its first 6 months while it heavily focused on acquiring customers. Sidecar didn't have the backup funding to do that on a similar scale.

Also, instead of focusing on its powerful technology and the empowerment their app gave to its users, they tried to place themselves as an affordable alternative to Uber, which didn't really work for them. Weeks after shutting down on December 2015, though, they were acquired by GM.

Flud distinguished itself from other news readers because users could save or store articles and news in the reading list for later reading. It was made to display RSS feeds from other blogs or news sites which made it easy for individuals to stream different sources of news - at the same time - on a single platform. Flud was considered as one of the best social news readers because it had a beautiful UI design, users could create profiles, follow other users, create communities and discussions around a topic and become major contributors by sharing their content.","The reason for which Flud joined the graveyard list of failed startups was mainly that they were unable to raise additional funding for their operations. Despite its various ways to raise money (including making it an enterprise), the company failed to become profitable and eventually ran out of cash.

Another reason the company failure could be attributed to was the unreliable volume of demand. The market was already filled with similar products and the competition was too high. When Flud came to be, Flipboard and Pulse were already the leading franchise in the field.

An additional reason why the company didn’t ultimately succeed was the lack of initial testing of the product. Moreover, they had sought the press too early on, without having a thoroughly tested product. The large media coverage the app received did Flud more damage than good because people, upon hearing about the app, would download it and try it out. Flud wasn’t expecting to have so many users download the app, so they suddenly had to deal with glitches and bugs. Having a faulty app when respected companies were praising it, might have cost them a bit of credibility and stopped the momentum they could have had."
CircleBack Lending,A P2P marketplace for online lending,Finances,United States,2012,2016,Shut Down,Bad Business Model,2,Manoj Ramnani & Patrick Questembert,10 to 50,1,12000000.0,4,"Founded in 2013, Circle Back Lending was launched as an online personal loans marketplace connecting potential borrowers with lenders who could lend them any amount ranging from $1000 payday loans to $35,000 Personal Loans for longer-term reasons (ranging from 36 to 60 months). The APR (Annual Percentage Rate) offered on these loans ranged from 6.63 to 35.82 % (credit cards have an APR between 17-24 %). Circle Back promised a quick inquiry process and a private and secure system that would send cash directly to your account after contact with and approval by a verified and registered lender.","The company saw some success initially and entered into a partnership with Jefferies Group LLC that was to help with the sale and securitization of $500 million in principal amount of consumer loans. The stated goal of this partnership with an established financial services firm was to provide loans to a much wider segment of the US population, which needed a responsible alternative to traditional bank loans and credit cards.

3 years down the line, the company was exposed in an article by Bloomberg that it had stopped giving out loans. This was mainly a result of borrowers failing to pay their loans.

For starters, in 2014, the company had generated a minuscule $4m in total loans (a year into its founding), but that didn’t stop Jefferies Group LLC from agreeing to securitize up to $500m of its loans. This is nothing new in the fin-tech world as shown by the $5 billion dollar deal that was inked in 2017 by industry leader Prosper (founded in 2005). Prosper Inc., which had been one of the pioneers of the P2P Online lending industry, was one of the earliest to turn to Wall Street to securitize its loans by repackaging them as bonds through the likes of Citigroup and others.

Then there has been a problem with the sudden firing of CEO s and top staff that was a regular occurrence at both Prosper, and Lending Club (another pioneer in the P2P lending business). The unexpected departure of Lending Club’s founding CEO put the entire industry in a tailspin as funding dried up.

Despite this, there seem to be much bigger and more fundamental problems that the entire P2P lending industry is ignoring.

1. With the advent of online banking, and the P2P companies relying on their own credit rating (like FICO), the line between banks and P2P lending has become blurred, and they are constantly diverging from the reason that this industry was founded (providing loans to those seen outside the scope of banks).

2. A far bigger problem that exists is the staggering rate at which P2P companies fail at returning capital to investors. A closer look into the P2P lending industry in China reveals some crucial data. The P2P industry fulfilled a growing need in the country, where bank loans were much harder to get by. But by the end of 2015, there were 1,031 total troubled platforms out of 3,448 platforms still in operation, with most of the problems being people that absconded with the cash. Despite much-needed regulation of the industry starting in 2018, the total number of platforms that went bust as of February 2019 were over 5000, with 177 million RMB ($25 million) in unpaid loans.

ChaCha,Search engine with a live human being,Software & Hardware,United States,2005,2016,Shut Down,Competition,2,Brad Bostic & Scott Jones,50 to 100,9,96000000.0,9,"ChaCha was a bit of “fresh air” being blown into the search engine industry. Back in 2006 when Facebook was in its infant years and Google had sort of established itself as a frontrunner to being the number one search engine on the Internet, ChaCha arrived seemingly out of nowhere.

In short, what the startup offered was a search engine where you could interact with a live human being - a “guide” of sorts, and then get the guides to manually search for the things that you were looking for on the Internet. So basically you just sat in the comforts of your own home and instead of having to search for things on your own, you could get someone to do it for you. What you did was simply logging on a chat interface and you told the guide what to search for. You could also chat and interact with the guide during the search.","To understand why ChaCha failed it’s important that you understand how search engines functioned back in 2006 and the early 2000’s. Back in the day, you couldn’t just type one single word and the search engine would find every, single relevant result, including results ‘near you’, as Google can nowadays. 

No, you really had to dig deep to find exactly what you were looking for. Search engines weren’t as complex as they are now, and their algorithms certainly didn’t do much of the thinking for you. In many cases, you had to manually search at least 3-4 pages of the search engine before you found a decent result, and even then it wasn’t as tailored to your request as it is nowadays. 

If you needed something specific found on the Internet, you needed a librarian who could quickly scout through a number of articles, websites and publications. A lot of the people who really understood how to find information fast on the Internet had a master’s degree because it was so complex and difficult to scour through the tons of information without any proper algorithm. 

However, ChaCha soon got stiff competition. Google released its Panda algorithm back in 2011 that virtually put it as the de facto information source on the Internet. If you searched for something on Google, you would be lucky to find results from sites like ChaCha, Ask.com, and Answers.com. They all got pushed further down. 

Not only that but at its peak, ChaCha had 55,000 virtual employees. They faced big management problems and there were even some cultural issues they had to take care of as well. The costs of hiring people to manual do research simply became too high, when comparing them with the results you could get from Google. And in addition, it became more difficult for the guides to give proper answers on subjective matters like politics, religion and so on. 

Ultimately, hiring people to manually search and give answers to questions wasn’t a sustainable project when Google offered the same thing, only through a simple online search."

Utrip was started on July 15, 2012, by Gilad Berenstein, his engineer-father Yair Berenstein, and Edan Shahar. They managed to raise a corpus of $4 million from some high profile investors that included Acorn Ventures, Tiempo Capital, and some executives from Apple and Costco.

Apart from helping travelers, they also had a white-label product called Utrip PRO which was sold to hotels, travel agencies, and DMOs (Destination Marketing Organizations) that wanted to offer travel planning on their websites. With millions of traveler profiles and data points gathered through its partnerships, it did look like they had cracked personalization for travelers. But unfortunately, it was not the case.","Despite having 80 clients, most of them had limited budgets which made it difficult for Utrip to gain traction and be profitable. The costs associated with sales, marketing and keeping the recommendation engine alive was too much for them since their expenses were higher than their revenue at one point. The investors wanted to see growth and there was no way they could show traction without spending more. They were caught in a vortex they had little control over as only an external push could save them. 

For Utrip to survive, they either had to find investors or be acquired. The founders turned to their biggest clients to see if they would be willing to invest in Utrip. Many of them balked at the idea because they were worried that they would be investing in a product that its competitors would use. 

Another aspect of its failure was that the founder himself admitted that they spent more on their technology and concentrated less on sales and marketing. B2C travel startups have a tough time driving traffic as the biggies like TripAdvisor and Expedia could easily outdo them with their marketing. 

There was also a lot of banter about how the investors were not properly communicated with during the fag end of the company. While there is no way to ascertain that, we can safely say that things weren’t okay between the founders and the investors. Media company Skift says that trip-planning startups have failed more than other companies in the travel space. 

A buyer was interested in Utrip, a 94-page acquisition document was prepared and just three days before the signing, the deal was called off. The lawyers of the buyer unearthed a patent by a rival company called WayBlazer that had a direct conflict with Utrip’s technology. Attempts to buy the patent from the company failed. Seven weeks after this incident, Utrip shut down.

Laurel & Wolf,Online interior design marketplace,e-Commerce,United States,2014,Active,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,2,"Brandon Kleinman, Leura Fine",50 to 100,4,25500000.0,14,"Launched in 2014 by Laure Fine and Brandon Kleinman, Laurel & Wolf was an online marketplace whose aim was to bring budget-friendly interior design solutions to customers through the Internet. Laurel & Wolf theorized that a  customer would pay a flat consultation fee to be paired up with a  designer over the company’s online platform. Though some small tweaks were made over the model and pricing over the years, its basic premise always revolved around cutting out the middleman to bring quality to the customers, a concept that SF venture funds bet largely on.","Even though Laurel & Wolf generally maintained a positive, marketable image, beginning the summer of 2018, the company’s reviews on sites like Yelp were populated with an influx of mainly one-star rants. Most of the reviewers complained that furniture and other items that they had ordered through the platform either arrived broken or were never delivered. Some clients also complained of having received substandard services and never receiving refunds that they claimed for. As a result of the poor publicity, a majority of Laurel & Wolf’s designers left the platform.

However, dissatisfied customers were not the only cause of Laurel and Wolf’s downfall. The company also had various disgruntled employees that were not happy with how it was being run. Despite this, the company tried to maintain their positive, quirky social image—going as far as having employees at dance classes and bowling excursions showcased on the company’s Instagram account. Behind closed doors, however, the atmosphere did not reflect the company’s joyful facade. For instance, while co-founder Laure Fine presented herself as being generally upbeat in her interviews, most employees recounted their fear of her. On many occasions, she would publicly and bluntly berate anyone that disagreed with her ideas. On top of this, despite being a design-based company, payouts to designers were generally small and were reduced without explanation.

It is hence not too difficult to conclude that Laurel & Wolf’s internal operations were quite chaotic. For a long period, it was running without any dedicated internal accounting, HR, or clear management structure. Moreover, their first office was cramped up and with just one bathroom. When they moved to a new building, it had a range of structural issues, tight packing and has sewage seeping into the ground floor which posed health risks. 

“They have to know they can’t treat people that way.” claimed a worker who quit the company just a few months after joining. “I would get in at about 8:30, and I wasn’t leaving until about 9:00 at night. I thought it was because we were so busy, but actually, the way we did things was just really complicated.” declared another.

Combined with large spendings in marketing and branding, all of these factors led to  Laurel & Wolf’s ultimate downfall. In March of 2019, the company closed its virtual shop and soon after, its website followed."
Navdy,Augmented driving device for cars,Transportation,United States,2013,2018,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,2,"Doug Simpson, Karl Guttag",50 to 100,4,41800000.0,20,"Navdy wanted to revolutionize automotive navigation through a heads-up display (HUD) model that projected the GPS navigation in front of you (much like in an airplane cockpit). The company's user-friendly device was meant to be installed on the dashboard of a car, right in front of the steering wheel and help make driving much safer by getting people to look straight ahead at the road rather than at their phones. Navdy also came up with its own ios app that linked up with the main HUD device and provided it with the relevant navigational output to display to the driver.

Navdy’s pitch was quite straightforward. Whereas head-up displays are increasingly common in some cars (generally performance or luxury models), they’re still a relative rarity on mainstream vehicles, and there’s usually no retrofitting possible from the automakers themselves. Their solution, therefore, was a device that mounted on the dashboard that included a small, transparent display panel within the driver’s line of sight that would project navigational information right in front of the driver.","Navdy's HUD device was initially priced at $799, but they soon found out that demand was not going to keep pace with such a highly-priced gadget as predicted. The price was soon slashed down to $499 but instead of an influx of new demand, Navdy would learn the hard way that the HUD market was extremely saturated. As previously states, the HUD display market is not something new and is quite common in high-end luxury cars. Navdy planned to create a new market for HUD navigational devices for the average user, but their price did not justify their stated goals.

More importantly, most users were complaining that Navdy’s HUD and its mobile app were not developed to satisfy customer needs appropriately. They argued that the display did not blend into the car’s windshield like some of its high-end competitors’ but that the device rather sat in front of the user’s line of view. This meant that Navdy’s HUD display was in no way a better display compared to looking at a GPS or phone mount that can be purchased for much less. A lot of the customers also felt that the product was very slow in displaying the GPS navigation from its dedicated ios app.

However, more than the product itself, what would really bring down Navdy was their quest to create their own complete navigation system that would substitute Google Maps or other such service providers. The costs for maintaining this service were not as cheap as they probably thought, and the price of maintaining such an expensive venture coupled with a lack of substantial demand for their product would prove to be the final nail in the coffin for Navdy. The company eventually went bust in 2018 due to these shortcomings.

It would then choose and present the one that most closely matched the user's specifications.","Desti wasn’t a faulty app on its own, nor were its services obsolete. The problem seemed to be that although users found the application to be useful and appreciated its location suggestions, they ultimately ended up doing the booking from other more trusted platforms or known brands. It followed that due to its failure to generate revenue from its service, investments came short in the Series A round.

There was also the fact that Desti was a newcomer in a sector which had already several giants such as TripAdvisor and Lonely Planet competing against themselves and to which users automatically resorted to.

Desti was ultimately acquired by Nokia with several members of the Desti team also ending up joining the Finnish multinational company.

The Nabi series of red padded tablets for kids, however, is their signature product.","Fuhu went bankrupt, even though it ranked 1st on the Inc 500 companies list for two years in a row.

The company amassed an enormous amount of debt and had a very high burn rate. The level of disregard for any type of financial management was so high that the firm had only one accountant and one bookkeeper despite its 300+ employees.

Fuhu had one good idea which brought them to the top, but could never replicate it and kept borrowing money in the millions from various companies with the hope that they will be able to produce the next Nabi and break even.

In particular, Fuhu owed Foxconn, a Chinese hardware manufacturer, between $60 to $110 million. The Chinese giant had previously already demanded from Fuhu to restrict its operational costs but little was done on that front. Suddenly, the company just decided to stop backing up Fuhu and everything fell apart for the private U.S. based company.

Later, Mattel purchased Fuhu’s assets for just $21.5 million. Fuhu’s CEO, Robb Fujioka, still hopes to come back with alternative ideas that will revolutionize the world and seems to have considered Fuhu’s faith as an experience every major entrepreneur faces at some point in their career."

There is no clear-cut reason for the venture failure but analyzing some of the available information might help us shed light on possible culprits. First, it probably had to do with the founders of the company and their lack of expertise in the field. Also, Tutorspree's vision of pairing up tutors and students to meet up in person so as to create and maintain a real connection is commendable but not practical. Although indeed, in-person lessons are still very much valuable, the market -and the world- is heading on to a different direction.

It is also possible that the platform,which was initially taking 50% of the tutor’s fees, might have witnessed a decline in overall user growth because nothing could prevent tutors and students to schedule lessons without recurring to Tutorspree after they got to know each other.

Another problem for Tutorspree's seemed to be that the company was primarily dependent on search traffic from Google to acquire new students and tutors, and any algorithm changes could significantly reduce their traffic and in return their users.

As resources started to dwindle and funding failed to come in, Tutorspree decided to shut down. Its assets (including its user's database) were bought by Wyzant, a tutoring marketplace launched in 2005 which is still active."

Yik Yak,Anonymous location-based social network,Social Media,United States,2013,2017,Shut Down,Legal Challenges,3,"Brooks Buffington, Tyler Droll, Will Jamieson",10 to 50,3,73500000.0,11,"Yik Yak was a proximity-based, anonymous social media app. People were able to make posts (Yaks), which were visible to other users in a 5-mile radius. Users could react to the posts by voting (up or down) or responding. Each user had Yakarma, which quantified the success of their posts, not unlike Reddit’s karma system.

Yik Yak enjoyed a lot of popularity especially in schools and college campuses throughout the US in 2013 and 2014. It became the 9th most downloaded social media app in the United States shortly after its launch in 2013 and reached 1.8 million downloads in September 2014.

The app was created by Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington who were college students at the time. The company they founded was initially funded by Atlanta Ventures and secured $1.5 million by other various investors. Once the app grew in popularity after its release, they were able to raise additional rounds of $10 million by the same investors and eventually $60 million by Sequoia Capital. At its peak, the business was valued between $350 and $400 million.

Yet, two years later Yik Yak was no more. On the 28th of April 2017, the company announced that it would be closing down in the coming week.","Yik Yak’s Fall in Popularity
The technical reason Yik Yak shut down is quite straightforward. In 2016 Yik Yak shrunk 75% compared to 2015. It was never a self-sustaining business, and when their popularity started decreasing rapidly there was no reason for their investors to continue to fund the project. The company laid off 60% of its workforce and was eventually forced to shut down. It sold its intellectual property to Square for $1 million, equal to 0.25% of its peak valuation.

The interesting question is why Yik Yak shrunk in popularity so rapidly after it had shown an obvious product-market fit.

‍

Yik Yak’s Cyberbullying Problem
Cyberbullying proved to be an insurmountable problem for Yik Yak and it played a major role in the apps decline.

Just a few examples to paint a picture:

In 2014, a school in Massachusetts was forced to evacuate its students twice after receiving bomb threats on the app.
Two other schools were forced to evacuate under threats of violence on the app.
Matthew Mullen was arrested by the police in Michigan because of Yaks (posts) he had made threatening a school shooting.
Campus police at the University of Missouri arrested Hunter M. Park because of threats of violence against black students he published on the app. He pleaded guilty to making a terrorist threat which resulted in a three-year suspended sentence combined with five years probation.
A student from Virginia Tech pleaded guilty of posting a threat on Yik Yak to repeat the 2007 campus shooting which took 32 lives.
These kinds of egregious offenses were more notable on Yik Yak compared to other social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook because of Yik Yak’s (presumed) anonymity. After all, you wouldn’t want to threaten a shooting with your name in plain sight.

That said, such heavy-duty offenses were somewhat rare nonetheless and you could argue that they would have taken place with or without the app. The real problem was the everyday bullying that took place on Yik Yak because it affected practically all of its users.

Jordan Seman, who had been repeatedly bullied on Yik Yak for her weight, posted an open letter about her problems:

“… when I scrolled through the message board and saw: “If I could bang a hippo for no finals, I would hunt down Jordan Seman.”
‍
My heart was pounding as I looked around the dining hall. A million things crossed my mind: Is someone watching me? Should I have worn this dress? Did someone see me eat that second cookie? Should I put on my jacket?
‍
In that moment, all of my insecurities flooded me. I felt exposed, betrayed and mostly embarrassed.”
Cases like hers lead to a vocal out-cry in the media and several colleges and schools banning the app on their grounds. Two feminist groups and a few former students even filed a federal complaint form against the University of Mary Washington in Virginia for failing to protect them from cyber-harassment and threats of sexual violence on the app.

The story isn’t black and white, however. Some people claimed Yik Yak plaid a positive role on campuses and others argued that the media reaction about the cyberbullying taking place on the app was very overblown. A study at MIT Media Lab compared it to Twitter and found that Yik Yak was less than 1% more likely to contain vulgar content.

All of that said, the hyper-localization of the app made cyberbullying on Yik Yak much more problematic compared to other social media platforms. If someone was bullying you on the app, you would know that they are near you in the real world. This means that even if the cyberbullying wasn’t more prevalent, it felt much more intense and threatening.

Jordan’s thought “Is someone watching me?” when she read the Yak on campus wouldn’t have occurred if the message was on a non-localized platform like Twitter.

Consequently, the media outcry and outright bans aren’t that surprising.

‍

Digital fences: Yik Yak killing its own business
In response to the pressure from the media and various schools and colleges, Yik Yak implemented geo-fencing. It disabled its users from using the app while on the territory of most middle and high schools in the US.

This reaction, however, was suicidal for the business, because the app simply killed half of its biggest use-case. Anonymity and localization meant that the app was most useful for school and college students:

People who are concentrated in one place in large numbers
Belong to the same institution and have many things in common
Might want to remain anonymous when stating an opinion in public
With this in mind, it’s extremely predictable that the app would decline in popularity after it directly killed its biggest market. Moreover, negative growth is fatal for a money-burning venture-funded social media depending on virility.

In hindsight, Yik Yak geo-fencing schools to deal with its cyberbullying problems is equivalent to a person shooting himself in the stomach to deal with his intense stomach-ache.

‍

Failing to manage toxicity through moderation
Yik Yak’s problems aren’t foreign to all other social media platforms. Cyberbullying is, sadly, a common theme on the internet. The common way to deal with it is automatic or even better – manual moderation. For example, Reddit has volunteer moderators on most communities on the site (subreddits) that make sure hate-speech and bullying don’t take place within said communities. Facebook, on the other hand, has paid moderators going through all content flagged by users as inappropriate.

Yik Yak did try to implement some form of automatic self-moderation. A user posing sensitive content would receive the message:

“Pump the brakes, this Yak may contain threatening language. Now it’s probably nothing and you’re probably an awesome person but just know that Yik Yak and law enforcement take threats seriously. So you tell us, is this Yak cool to post?”

Yet, their efforts were obviously insufficient. A solution similar to that of Reddit might have done wonders for them. Moderation presents problems of its own – it risks becoming over-sensitive, removing any kind of controversial content even when it’s not damaging. That said, it’s far better than the alternative, especially bearing in mind Yik Yak was heavily affected by the cyberbullying problem because of their hyper-localization and young user base.

Rdio developers wanted to offer a product that was beautiful, flawless and social. One of the interesting features of that app was that it would show you what your friends were listening to and would give you music recommendations based on your circle of friends’ playlists.","Although Rdio developed an excellent product, its weakness was in the close to non-existent marketing and distribution department. The fact that they reached the market before Spotify, didn’t help them as the little momentum they initially had was completely lost once Spotify appeared on the scene.

For one, Spotify had an impressive marketing strategy and a business model that made it easier for them to gain more subscribers. While Rdio required users to become paying customers to listen to their streaming service, Spotify broke that entry barrier and offered free music thanks to the paid advertising it incorporated into its product.

Rdio tried a couple of pivoting strategies but these came too late and Spotify had already gained 75 million users (they surpassed 140 million in 2017, 50 million of which were paying subscribers). A mix of bad timing, reluctant leadership, and wrong priorities was what finally caused Rdio to go out of business."

37Coins stated that delivering monetary funds across different carriers outside of the USA was “Unreliable.”

Furthermore, 37Coins said that their “initial objective was not possible to achieve with the amount of capital raised.” The startup stopped its operations mainly because of lack of sufficient funds.

Circa,Mobile news app on diverse topics,Entertainment,United States,2011,2015,Acquired,Lack of Funds,3,"Arsenio Santos, Ben Huh, Matt Galligan",10 to 50,8,4700000.0,39,"Circa was a promising startup in the news sector that had the ambitious mission of ‘fixing’ what was wrong with journalism. More specifically, the product this San Francisco based company came up with was a news app that pushed notifications to the user’s phone and delivered digestible bit-sized news specifically for mobiles, at a time at which no news company had yet tried the model. The company offered ‘atomized’ news rather than a summary, which means they broke down the news to its core elements; stats, facts, media, and quotes. Links to different sources were also given so that users could read the full story. Users had also the option of following up on a story and receive updates for specific news.","Circa seems to have gone out of business because they suffered a financial breakdown. In an article titled “Farewell to Circa News” the company stated that producing high-quality news proved to be a costly endeavor and without the capital necessary to support further production they were unable to continue. The company found out that building a revenue stream would take time and only by having enough venture capital they would be able to sustain their operations.

Although their concept was new and innovative, it was quickly copied by giants in the news sector. Circa was unlikely to be able to compete with renowned prints staff nor with their advertising outreach.

Circa was deemed to fail exactly because of the model and strategy it had chosen. Since news were only digests of news they had no strong emotional pull. Users didn’t spend much time on Circa, even after they briefly opened the app, they would go back to the other social and engaging applications that could offer them not only near real-time news but also social interactions.

The company considered monetizing their site by introducing advertisements or charging a subscription for its product but they felt that these minor solutions wouldn’t have made a difference nor provide a high-quality experience to their users, so they decided against it."

What Dinner Lab offered was a culinary experience that would take diners away from the traditional dining experience and let them share new dishes with a group of strangers in unusual places. People could sign up for a membership plan and would receive an invitation, ideally 2 to 4 times a month, to take part of a unique experience enriched by exotic food and new people.","The first problem Dinner Lab encountered had to do with the timing at which they offered the meals. Originally, the event would take place at midnight, but pretty soon the company team discovered people at 12:00 am of a weekend tended to be drunk and were both unreliable customers and not really enhancing the experience of the other participants. So, although the idea sounded adventurous and fun, it was impractical and people aren’t used to dine at midnight.

According to Dinner Lab CEO, the company was very challenging to manage as there always was a multitude of variables they had to keep up with, from the food served and its ingredients, to the location, diners registration and turnaround and the staff kept on changing.

Although most customers enjoyed the experience, people complained that there were never enough tickets and never enough events going on. In some cities, people who signed up for a membership which would include at least 2 events per month, ended up having only 1 event every 6 weeks while still having to pay a full subscription.

Dinner Lab blamed the difficulty of having more events on the dwindling running capital. They decided to hire contract workers instead of full-timers with the hope that would decrease the cost. Dinner Lab also tried to sell diners’ surveys to restaurants but without success. They finally found the model unsustainable and closed in 2016 after 5 years of operations."
Call9,On-demand doctors in emergency situations,Health,United States,2015,2019,Shut Down,Bad Business Model,3,"Celina Tenev, Timothy Peck, XiaoSong Mu",100 to 250,3,34000000.0,10,"Instead of having to call 911 and wait for hours in a nursing room, not knowing if you were going to die or not, Call9 offered a different option. Call9 was especially targeted to patients in the home care industry who needed the urge to speak with a doctor right away about their issues.

The solution was simple. Instead of calling, each patient would be given some medical equipment and an iPad. Using the iPad, the patients could call in to their doctor and get medical advice - in their own living room instead of having to call an ambulance or even drive somewhere by themselves.","One of the core values of the company was to operate on a so-called “value cared basis”. What that meant was that doctors wouldn’t necessarily get paid a flat fee per hour or per consultation, but rather according to how the patient felt after they’d been treated.

So, if the patient felt that the doctor didn’t help them at all, they could justify paying less money or nothing at all. Naturally, this became a problem when dealing with employees who were demanding their money. And also, the USA adopted very slowly to dealing with this kind of relationship between doctors and patients. 

But there might have been other factors involved, too. Call9 had inked deals with Lyft for patient transportation and were planning to expand to Albany, NY, from their base located in Brooklyn. Not only that, but they also operated a community paramedicine division by using their emergency doctor network.

In other words, they had a big vision, and they were expanding their business. But they might have expanded a little too fast with too much money. And that is because, shortly before they shut down their operations, it was learned that the company was entering a bit of a ‘stealth mode’. That was likely because they were still in their early stages as a healthcare startup and struggled with their financial situation.

Call9 acquired some partnerships with various companies in the healthcare industry, and the idea was to make a turn and focus on technology in nursing homes. Ultimately, this plan failed and the company just didn’t have what it took to make it in the tough and cruel world of health tech startups.

One last point is that investors nowadays have less patience than what they did - they want to get back the money they invested rather quick. Things aren’t like they used to be in the early 2000’s where you’d make headlines by getting a 5 Million Dollar round from well-known investors and you’d get invited to conferences and VIP cocktail parties. Now, investors expect results fast. And if you can’t deliver, you won’t survive.

Shyp,On-demand shipping startup,Transportation,United States,2013,2018,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,3,"Jack Smith, Joshua Scott, Kevin Gibbon",10 to 50,3,62100000.0,34,"The world of on-demand startups has been a lucrative one since the founding and subsequent rise of Uber a decade ago. Shyp wanted to do exactly that with an on-demand shipping service in mind. More precisely, Shyp wanted to provide a service that would allow you to take a photo of whatever you want to be shipped, and then upon uploading it on the accompanying mobile app, have a courier pick it up and deliver it to the company headquarters where employees would then box the item using their own high-end custom-packaging and ship it via a FedEx, UPS, or other similar delivery services.

Ad","Started in the summer of 2013, Shyp had everything that San Francisco-based venture capitalists were looking for. For starters, they operated on an app-based business model that was the epitome of recent on-demand service models that were scaling to take the whole world by storm and independent couriers that were personable and incentivized to often arrive before their 20-minute promised time—unsurprisingly a hit with customers. This attracted the likes of Tim Ferris, Naval Ravikant, Slow Ventures, and Kleiner Perkins among many others to participate in the company’s hefty raise of $62 million during their operations. Later on, Shyp also was able to partner with the e-commerce giant Ebay. So what happened that led to their shutdown barely 5 years into existence? 

To begin with, Shyp had vastly overestimated the number of individuals that would regularly ship their items anywhere, let alone pay a flat $5 fee for something simple as a courier picking up and packing your items, regardless of its size. On top of this flaw, they also started charging an extra $3 packaging fee for the marked-up shipping cost. Unlike essential services like cab rides and food delivery that most people would now use at least on a weekly basis, shipping items is a rare and often sporadic activity. To account for this, Shyp started to get small businesses (that ship on a regular basis) into becoming part of their shipping revolution and even started offering volume discounts. This still did not stop the company from shutting down by early 2018. 

In a personal LinkedIn article in 2018, company CEO Kevin Gibbon admits he didn’t listen. “At the time,” he wrote, “I approached everything as an engineer. Rather than change direction, I tasked the team with expanding geographically and dreaming up innovative features and growth tactics to further penetrate the consumer market.” He also said that ""growth, at all costs, is a dangerous trap that many startups fall into, mine included.” In the case of Shyp, the costs that came with packaging materials, renting out physical warehouses and hiring drivers while doing their best to keep prices low to attract customers, made for finer margins and greater demand for using up the startup capital than other ventures."
Anki,Building emotionally intelligent robots,Software & Hardware,United States,2010,2019,Shut Down,Lack of Funds,3,"Boris Sofman, Hanns Tappeiner, Mark Palatucci",100 to 250,5,182000000.0,6,"Anki was a robotics and AI startup founded in 2010 that aimed to integrate robotics and IoT (Internet of Things) into children's toys and games. Anki programmed objects so that they could be intelligent and adapt to the physical world, with the aim of solving the problems of positioning, reasoning, and execution in artificial intelligence and robotics. 

Their first successful product was the Anki Drive; which combined a toy racing car and track set with an iOS app for controlling and programming the toy cars. Anki also released other successful products like Anki Overdrive (the successor of Anki Drive) and an interactive toy robot called Cozmo, as well as a more advanced version of Cozmo, called the Vector. The sophistication of Cozmo even made it to Carnegie Mellon University (the founders’ alma mater), where it was used for college-level robotics classes. Cozmo, in fact, came with programing tools ranging from a simple drag-and-drop interface based on MIT’s Scratch Blocks to a full software development kit in the Python programming language.

According to Boris Sofman, the company’s CEO and co-founder, their goal was to create robots that “feel alive.” This included creating naturalistic imperfections in how they moved around, for example. This was in order to make them appear more lifelike to their human companions. Anki’s Cozmo and its successor Vector were 2 products that showed quite a high level of sophistication in what was coined as ""AI emotional intelligence""; which in other words means the capacity to show ""emotion"" to new stimuli.

The company received $50 million in Series A and Series B venture funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, and Two Sigma. In September 2014, Anki announced that it had raised another $55 million in Series C venture funding led by JP Morgan. In June 2016, the company announced its latest round of funding, which amounted to $52.5M, also led by JP Morgan. The total funding to date is $182.5 million.","Anki barely lasted for a decade and completely ceased operations by the end of April 2019. This is not something you would expect from a company that is a brainchild of Carnegie Mellon graduates, and a company that raised close to $200 million in VC funding. The products that Anki produced were also performing really well in the market and at a competitive price tag of under $300, they seemed to do what their competitors in this industry could not. In fact, according to many sources (like Amazon US), Cozmo was the best selling toy of 2017. So what took this promising startup eventually to the grave?

A failed round of financing was reportedly to blame. CEO Boris Sofman told employees that a deal had failed to materialize “at the last minute”, as it also happened with acquisition interests from companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Comcast.

An article published by The Robot Report provides some more information about Anki’s case. According to it, Silicon Valley Bank had a security interest in Anki’s copyrights, patents, and trademarks since March 30, 2018. To receive a loan from SVB, Anki had to put up its intellectual property as collateral. If Anki failed to repay the loan, SVB had the right to seize the collateral to make up for the money it lost in the loan. The report also stated that Fisher & Richardson, a global IP law firm, filed a lien against Anki on June 3, 2019, because it “has not been compensated for patent and trademark prosecution services that it provided for Anki”.

However, can these financial debacles be the sole reason, or is there something inherent within the robotics industry that is to blame? 

A quick look at the failure of other robotics companies within the last year paints a very clear picture. There needs to be a rethink as to the functionality and not just the novelty factor (which tends to fade out very quickly) when thinking of designing the next successful home robot. It is like what Roomba and Alexa have done within the past decade (specialized and functional robots that actually do the job they are meant for).    

A major failure, for example, was Jibo, founded in 2012 by famed MIT roboticist Cynthia Breazeal (a pioneer researcher in human-robot interaction). Jibo went on to successfully raise over $3.5 million when its Indiegogo campaign ended in 2014. They raised a further $73 million in VC funding and Jibo was touted as the first social robot for the home that would actually dance around for you! Another similar failure was the shutdown of Mayfield Robotics. They had released their famed Kuri robot that was touted as being a roaming security camera with a personality. Both robots came with a high price tag and their novelty wore off among users very soon, leading to their shutdowns in late 2018. 

The epic failure of Cozmo and Vector proved the fact even further that despite a successful product line and competitive price tags if products (no matter how well designed) do not prove their value in the consumer market, they will not lead to a sustainable business model for the companies investing in them."
Munchery,Gourmet meals at your doorstep,Food & Beverage,United States,2011,2019,Bankruptcy,Multiple Reasons,3,"Conrad Chu, Tri Tran, Van Tran",100 to 250,8,125400000.0,20,"Back in 2010, Munchery co-founders Tri Tran and Conrad Chu came up with a seemingly brilliant idea in Munchery. Hiring a team of gourmet chefs that would cook up a variety of uniquely crafted, continually changing menus, Munchery allowed users to order this food and have it delivered straight to their doorstep. Customers would then be able to rate the food and the chefs according to their satisfaction. This idea of gourmet meals on-demand allowed the company to raise its most recent $125 million in total funding and was speculated to be valued at $300 million at its peak.","Munchery had a very interesting growth story. For the first few years, as a San Francisco-based platform for on-demand, microwavable gourmet meals, the business did quite well. Riding on the momentum of early success, in 2015, Munchery, in a bid to outdo its rival Blue Apron, branched into offering ingredients for customers to make their own meals (and providing them the appropriate recipes to do so). The San Fransisco-based startup continued to generate a lot of media buzz and expanded into New York, Seattle, and Los Angeles soon after. They were outperforming Blue Apron and almost every other on-demand food delivery startup, attributed to the convenience their microwavable foods model brought and Munchery’s pride on the quality control they offered that other on-demand startups, who depended upon restaurants, couldn't. They also prided themselves in sourcing 100% natural ingredients and working efficiently under their schedule-ahead model that constantly optimized the efficiency of their couriers.

So what went wrong with this seemingly successful business?

Pascal Rigo, a celebrated chef who at one point served as Munchery’s Chief Customer Experience Officer, stated in his interview with the San Francisco Chronicle that “[startups] can be either a good food company or a good delivery company, but I don’t think anyone has been able to do both.” He left the company in 2015, after just 5 months of joining. Munchery’s attempt to juggle both of these titles led to difficulties at scale.

Munchery also realized late that its original heat-and-serve meals had geographical constraints, as to ensure quality, food had to be delivered within a short drive of its kitchens. To accommodate for this, Munchery accelerated its expansion, setting up expensive production kitchens in Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle. These proved to be too expensive both financially and logistically, and the new kitchens were shut down by May of 2018. Additionally, new competition from Uber’s Eats spinoff and DoorDash started to kick in and Munchery soon could not match the variety offered by these companies that could source from multiple restaurants.

Another area where Munchery failed was in acquiring new customers. They attempted to use aggressive discounts to achieve success in this sector, offering things like $20 off a user’s first two orders and subscription plans that offered a free 1-month subscription to first-time customers. However, despite these efforts, Munchery failed to retain customers in any significant way. These disappointments led to Tri Tran stepping down from the position of CEO, replaced by James Beriker, who employed a slew of layoffs and other belt-tightening measures. Beriker also raised prices, which would only lead to a further downward spiral for the company amidst increasing competition.

Despite its ambitious mission, Munchery could not deliver on the gourmet experience that it promised and closed its doors to users, alongside similar decisions by startups Spring and Maple—early concepts of the “ghost kitchen” that shut down and was acquired earlier in 2017, respectively.

The company’s online market stage was designed with the goal of productively offering, purchasing, stockpiling and delivering second-hand furniture to its customers. Its focus was to meet the requirement for furniture transfer and urge individuals to reuse furniture while expanding the day and age in which furniture was utilized. Its target was on persons who needed to move houses and sell their furniture or those who desired to revamp their household furniture.","Move Loot officially closed down in July 2016. One of the key issues pointed out was its poor plan of action. They selected to work a substantial furniture stockroom without precisely thinking about the expenses of running it and the assessed benefits. Thus, costs continued soaring while benefits stayed low. The startup also tried to expand and grow to New York and Los Angeles in the expectation of accepting some guaranteed financing. This lopsided cost – income condition prompted mass lay off of its employees.

Move Loot tried to move quickly and attempted to aggressively scale up to its vision a little too fast. Move Loot would bounce starting with one model idea and then dive onto the next one before basically evaluating if the past model even worked. After some rumors of an incoming partnership and acquisitions that never materialized, poor customers review and massive internal layoffs, Move Loot had to officially bring its operations to a stop.

Although no further details were divulged following such closure, the company probably failed in its marketing strategy and product placement. Another possible reason for low revenue generation could have been the company's product pricing strategy which might have not resonate well with its initial clients that had originally used the app as an alternative to Evernote."

It was well built and designed featuring many of the elements that made others social networks successful. The network’s CEO, also the founder of a parenting magazine, sought to bring forth a network that appealed to baby-boomers in which they could share insights and learn from each other.

Ad","As the network’s CEO put it “the site’s business model wasn’t able to grow its user base big enough and fast enough to survive”.

Middle-aged people might have signed up out of curiosity but the platform probably didn’t have the same traction and influence that sites which aim at a younger demographic have. It’s more likely that it is mainly teenagers and people in their twenties who are more prone be active in online social platforms, inviting friends, sharing content and spending time on it. LinkedIn is an exception here. LinkedIn has a user base of 192 million users who are aged 30 and over, yet the network was successful and gained traction because its central focus was on building business connections. It was later able to transform part of its users to consumers by offering premium plans, acting as a recruiter company and introducing business-oriented courses. TeeBeeDee had nothing of the sort and it was essentially an interesting place to go to when you had some time (i.e. not very much when you are an adult with a family and a work overload), instead of a place that you had to or needed to check every day.

And lastly, within few years of TBD’s launch, a plethora of social networking sites emerged and TeeBeeDee’s site views kept declining. The project failed to gather ulterior funding and it shut down in 2009."

Its main services were Parse Core to save data, Parse Cloud to run custom app codes, Parse Push for notification purposes, and Parse Analytics which had stats and optimization insights.","Parse was a growing popular service in the developer’s community and when Facebook offered to purchase the startup in 2013 for $85 million, Parse’s founders found that it made sense for their business to join Zuckerberg's team.

Facebook bought Parse at a time in which its stock was trading for lower than their IPO and it was not yet confident of how far its business model based on ad-serving would take them and wanted to test other possible business ideas. Thanks to Parse, Facebook was able to create a community of mobile app developers for itself. There could have also been a brief vision of developing cloud services that would match those offered by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. However, once the Facebook business model was consolidated in the last few years making the billions, the social network lost interest in competing with the other giants in the cloud business as it would cost them millions of dollars. They were too far behind and Parse couldn't provide them with a long-term profitable source of revenue, in fact, it was most likely losing money. Facebook decided to shut down Parse in 2017 to let the team focus on other projects.

It initially tried to do that by providing a gateway for communication between politicians and their citizens. After the pivot, they started creating and designing data visualization tool using their data set for institutions like schools. Also, they created a paid access terminal that assisted people to make their own data visualization. Poliana also tried to sell information and data visualization to media groups in small and large scale depending on their audience. In particular, they collected data on who exactly funded politicians so as to create transparency and a better understanding of who’s agenda a particular politician was trying to implement since there was a high correlation between the source of the funding politicians receive and the bills they would pass (or prevent from passing).","Poliana had low market demand and ran out of finances even though they tried to implement three different business models with schools, news agencies and the public at large.

The idea of creating a data visualization tool for school and university students did not work. To penetrate in the schools required strong connection to the school administrators, which the company did not have. It was difficult to make money from projects that were meant to be free to the public. There was no demand for viewing graphs which the public had to pay for first. Poliana allowed the public to see the graphs, but to make their own data they had to pay via SaaS model thus incurring expensive charges. Poliana also attempts with local news media were unsuccessful as they had little interest in what the company offered while middle news media were interested but lacked the budget for visualization data technology. International and national media had their own set of experts and data hence the information offered by the company was irrelevant.

There was a fourth profit model that was suggested by many users but which Poliana decided not to pursue. The model involved selling visualization data and information to politicians. The Poliana team argued that the model might compromise their ethics and go against their very principles when they started the project hence they refrained from creating it. Poliana decided to share their code and open source it in its entirety and suspended their operations in 2015.

Appiterate delivered a lot of personalized notifications on its campaigns each month, roughly around 100 million targeted and specific notifications for various platforms of different e-commerce sites. This target-specific campaign technique by Appiterate landed some huge scores for those e-commerce sites who reportedly had a whopping 300% increase in their total revenue.","Appiterate didn’t technically fail but was rather acquired by Flipkart. Flipkart is India’s largest e-commerce company. The company has been serving their customers mainly on their online website, Flipkart.com, but things started to change when Flipkart saw how lucrative mobile phone apps were becoming. For over the last few years, the company noticed that their overall traffic mostly came from smartphones and tablets. The only logical move for the company to maximize their profits was to move on and develop a mobile phone-based application for their e-commerce website.

This is where Appiterate comes in. The startup vast experience working with e-commerce sites made them the perfect candidate for Flipkart’s acquisition. Appiterate services were deemed perfect for Flipkart’s goal to expand their sales by moving on with the trends and focusing more on developing a mobile-based campaign strategy for the growing Indian market and the deal went through in 2015.

This meal-based startup provided fast delivery times with low or no fees whenever there was low demand.

The ingredients were sometimes inspected from the point of origin by the chef so as to ensure that they had the best quality. All the ingredients used for the meals were locally-sourced, sustainable, and seasonal.","The on-demand food business was a tough arena to venture in. Sprig tried to handle all elements of the experience, like sourcing, cooking and delivering the food but soon found the whole process time consuming and besides being expensive, it required a continuous and seamless management and integrated logistics.

Sprig would sometimes deliver free of change to the clients, but this raised expenses and caused them to have a lower profit margin. They also struggled to pay workers, working premises bills and the necessary products.

Another downside with delivery-based food services like Sprig was that they did not offer a place where customers could go and have meals, while often a good dining experience and service is what entices people to become repeat customers.

Spring had a shortage of finance to run its business and faced stiff competition from other already established companies such as Seamless, UberEats, Blue Apron and Domino."

On June 9, 2011, the owners of the site decided to entirely focus on sales and daily design inspiration. The company grew so rapidly that it even surpassed Facebook’s record when it was able to reach the 1 million subscribers milestone within six months. The company grew their sales and exposure, even more when they introduced a social-concept similar to Facebook which enabled users to share the purchases they made on Fab.com on an interface called “Inspiration wall”.","Fab’s success echoed around the world, resulting in companies launching their own same exact replicas of Fab’s platform, including the Samwer brothers, who are known for launching replicas of thriving American businesses abroad like ebay, Amazon, etc. This news troubled Fab’s CEO. Jason Goldberg. To secure sales in the European region, Fab’s CEO insisted on acquiring three new startups in the region. The move to prematurely expand to Europe ultimately costed Fab over $60-$100 million dollars in capital.

A former Fab employee said that the decision to move towards Europe would’ve been fantastic if it had been done in a subsequent period, after the company became fully established in the U.S. The expansion led to serious funding issues inside the board.

Furthermore, in an attempt to solve the slow delivery rate to their customers, Fab decided to buy their own warehouse in New Jersey. This solution was initially successful as the delivery time went down from 16.5 days to only 5.5 days.  This became the perfect opportunity for Fab to exponentially grow their product inventory. Sales rose up rapidly but what the company didn’t immediately seem to realize was that by scaling up their inventory, they would lose their competitive edge for which they were known for, “providing personal and intimate designs”. The company focused too much of the funds on several initial marketing campaigns which led people into buying an initial product but didn’t help in developing customer purchase patterns they could rely on. The plan on expanding their product inventory backfired as customers realized that they could find the same products for a cheaper price and a faster delivery on Amazon. Customers left Fab in exchange for a better service from Amazon.

In the middle of 2014, CEO Jason Goldberg concluded that it was better to sell the remaining parts of Fab to a prospective company.  In the end, the $1-billion-dollar worth company was sold to PCH Innovations for only $15 million dollars."

MySpace,Social network based on personal user pages,Social Media,United States,2003,Active,Still Active,Multiple Reasons,7,"Aber Whitcomb, Brad Greenspan, Chris DeWolfe, Colin Digiaro, Josh Berman, Michael Addicott, Tom Anderson",250 to 500,1,37800000.0,2,"MySpace was originally launched as a side project. Started as a spin-off of Friendster, it grew rapidly to become the most popular social networking site before Facebook entered the scene. It gained 1 million users in about one month after it was officially launched in 2004 and by 2005 it had 20 million registered users. Upon registration on the site, users were given profile pages they could personalize, write posts or blogs, connect with others through comments or messages, share art, stream their own music or that of their favorite artists. The platform principally made profits by serving ads to its users which reached about 76 million in 2008.","MySpace was founded by people in the industry and marketing sector and their perspective of the platform was since the beginning very different from that of Facebook, which nevertheless became its primary competitor. MySpace tried first to ignore Facebook, then to copy it and lastly decided to repurpose itself as a platform for artist and musicians.

There are several reasons why it’s thought that MySpace lost to Facebook. Starting from its poorly organized interface to the often-faulty technology and applications on the site, it was clear that although MySpace had a superb marketing strategy, from the technical side they were way behind other platforms. They later tried to remedy these problems by offering a cleaner design and allowing third-party companies to provide applications for the site.

Since MySpace revenue source was ads serving, it was pressured by investors and partners into taking an aggressive ad publishing strategy, which made their pages even less attractive to users.

In 2010, it’s estimated that 50% of MySpace users simply left and discontinued their use of the site and that continued as the once popular site kept changing ownership and direction every few years.

Besides buggy technology and poor management, the company also faced public image issues when the site started being associated with dubious or even scandalous figures thus alarming parents and earning MySpace negative press coverage. This only accelerated users flock to other platforms such as FB that offered the additional incentive of providing users with news and interactions related to their real-life friends as opposed to anonymous people.

MySpace is currently active and receives an estimated 15 million visitors per month as of 2016 (for comparison, Facebook has 2.07 billion monthly active users), currently has 53 million songs on the platform and an average of 13 thousand songs uploaded every day on the platform."
