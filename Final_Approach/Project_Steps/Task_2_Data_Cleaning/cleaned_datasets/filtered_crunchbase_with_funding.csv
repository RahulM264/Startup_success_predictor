ChoreRelief combines the main elements of both networks and marketplaces. We use SaaS workflow software to focus action around longer-term projects, not just a quick transaction. The tool lets repair and maintenance professionals perform critical tasks, send bids, and collect payments, etc. It promotes these service providers as differentiated individuals, helping build long-term relationships with clients.

It also permits property managers, landlords, and homeowners with an opportunity to post their repair and maintenance needs, and optionally, the budget within which they’re working. This streamlines the match-making process for both parties.

Customers and providers are each unique; they are not interchangeable commodities as with Lyft or Uber. Each person brings unique expertise, needs, and viewpoints to the transaction and the relationship. Our market network is designed to acknowledge that as a core tenet and provide solutions that accommodate it. The company’s mission is to expand globally while seamlessly connecting property owners with contractors. The result is more accessible talent, affordable rates, a single source for the endless needs of property owners, and more business for contractors.

We view ourselves as innovators and collaborators, not competitors. That’s why we do our best to build networks that promote collaboration among contractors.
